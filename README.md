# Vector Atlas Project 
Tan Pei Hua (Hua)

## Overview
This project aims to understand the structure of a spatial dataset from various sources and develop a detailed methodology to clean, filter, and combine the data. Ultimately, the goal is to create a comprehensive map visualisation of the spatial distribution of vector species, with a primary focus on the Asian continent. The visualisation is generated using a combination of species occurrence data from multiple sources, including the Malaria Atlas R package, GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), and VectorBase.
